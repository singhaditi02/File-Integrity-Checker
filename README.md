A file integrity fie or also known as File Integrity Checker(FIM), is a security tool that ensures files haven't been altered or tampered with. It works by creating a baseline checksum of a file and then periodically camparing it to the current checksum of the same fie. Any discrepancies indicates potential unauthorized changes.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
DATA PROTECTION: FIM hels protect sensitive data by ensuring it remains unchanged and hasn't been compromised.
SECURITY COMPLIANCE: Many regulatory standards, like PCI DSS and HIPAA, requie file interity monitoring to ensure systems haven't been tampered with.

This whole project is made using pythonprogramming language using vc code.
